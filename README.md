# Project Overview
Overview
In this project, you will make use of R to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. You will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics and making visualizations!

# What Software Do I Need?
You can perform all operations directly within the classroom. However, if you would like to work on your local machine, you will need to install R.

# What Does A Submission Look Like?
There are two possible ways to submit your work. You may submit your work using the classroom notebook, which you will find in the Project Workspace part of this lesson. The details of what should be in your notebook are shared on the next pages of this lesson.

# Project Details
Bike Share Data
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.

In this project, you will use data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. You will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

# The Datasets
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
User Type (Subscriber or Customer)
The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

Gender
Birth Year

# The Files
You will answer your questions of interest about the Motivate datasets using R. To help guide your work in this project, a template with helper code and comments is provided in a notebook file on the next page. You will need the three city dataset files too:

chicago.csv
new_york_city.csv
washington.csv
All three of these data files are zipped up in the Bikeshare file in the resource tab in the sidebar on the left side of this page. You may download and open up that zip file if you want to do your project work on your local machine. Otherwise, they are also available directly in the workspace.
